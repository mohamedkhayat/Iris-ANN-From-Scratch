Overview


This repository contains an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) built from scratch using NumPy and Python to classify the Iris dataset. The project demonstrates the fundamentals of constructing and training an ANN without relying on high-level libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.


Components


train.py: Contains the code to train the ANN model. This script uses NumPy to build and train the neural network on the Iris dataset.

app.py: Provides a Flask API for interacting with the trained model. This API allows users to send data to the model and receive predictions.

Java Frontend GUI:

Located in the java folder.
Includes code for a graphical user interface application built with JavaFX.
Provides an interface for users to input data and visualize predictions from the ANN model.
Executable: Contains the compiled version of the Java GUI application, allowing users to run the application without needing to compile the code themselves.

Executable:

Located in the root of the repository.
A compiled version of the Java GUI application.
To run the executable, follow these steps:
Start the Flask API by running python python/app.py.
Open the executable file to launch the JavaFX GUI application.
Use the GUI to interact with the model and view predictions.

Dependencies


Python:

numpy: For numerical operations and matrix manipulations.

pandas: For handling the Iris dataset.

flask: For creating the API to interact with the model.

Java:

JavaFX: For building the graphical user interface.

Dataset


Iris Dataset: Chosen for its simplicity and educational value. The limited number of instances may affect the modelâ€™s robustness, particularly in classifying the versicolor class.
Results

Future Work


Future improvements will involve:

Revisiting the project with a more appropriate dataset to enhance model performance and generalizability.

Further refining the ANN architecture and training process to address current limitations.
