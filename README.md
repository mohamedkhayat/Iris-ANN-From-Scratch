# Iris-ANN-From-Scratch

This repository contains an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) built from scratch using NumPy and Python to classify the Iris dataset. It demonstrates the fundamentals of constructing and training an ANN without relying on high-level libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.


While the Iris dataset was chosen for its simplicity and educational value, its limited number of instances may not provide the most robust testing ground for the model. Consequently, the model struggles with classifying the versicolor class. Despite this, the project has been successful in achieving its primary goal: implementing an ANN from scratch.


This project serves as a valuable learning experience, highlighting the challenges and intricacies of building and training neural networks from the ground up. Future work will likely involve revisiting this project with a more appropriate dataset to enhance the model's performance and generalizability.
